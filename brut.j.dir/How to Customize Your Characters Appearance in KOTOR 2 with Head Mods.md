## What are head mods?
 
Head mods are modifications that replace the default heads of the playable characters in KOTOR 2 with new ones. They usually come with custom portraits, textures, and sometimes voice files. Some head mods are standalone, meaning they only affect one head option, while others are part of a larger mod that changes multiple heads or other aspects of the game. Head mods can be compatible or incompatible with each other, depending on how they are made and installed.
 
## How to install head mods?
 
The easiest way to install head mods is to use the Steam Workshop, which allows you to subscribe to mods and have them automatically downloaded and updated. To access the Steam Workshop, you need to have KOTOR 2 on Steam and launch it from there. Then, go to the Community tab and click on Workshop. You can browse through the available mods by category or search for keywords. Once you find a mod you like, click on Subscribe and wait for it to download. You can also unsubscribe from a mod if you don't want it anymore.
 
If you don't have KOTOR 2 on Steam or prefer to install mods manually, you will need to download them from other sources, such as GameFront or Deadly Stream. These sites host many mods that are not available on the Steam Workshop, but they require more steps to install. You will need to extract the mod files from a compressed archive (such as .zip or .rar) and copy them to the Override folder in your game directory. The Override folder is where the game looks for custom files that override the default ones. If you don't have an Override folder, you can create one yourself. Be careful not to overwrite any files that are already in the Override folder, as this may cause conflicts or errors. To uninstall a mod, you will need to delete its files from the Override folder.
 
## How to use head mods?
 
Once you have installed a head mod, you can use it by selecting it from the character creation screen or by using a save game editor. The character creation screen lets you choose your character's gender, class, portrait, name, and appearance. You can scroll through the available heads and see how they look on your character. Some head mods may have different names or icons than the default ones, so pay attention to the descriptions. If you want to change your character's appearance after creating them, you will need to use a save game editor, such as KSE (KOTOR Savegame Editor). This tool allows you to edit various aspects of your save files, including your character's attributes, inventory, quests, and appearance. You can change your character's head by selecting it from a list of options. Be sure to backup your save files before using a save game editor, as it may corrupt them if used incorrectly.
